in Person class there are two constructors used, 1 is empty constructor which can be invoked when the new instance
with empty parameter, the other is traditional constructor which invoked by fully parameters provided.

in Dog class there are 3 different constructors as well, but one is named "static factory method" which can be
invoked as ClassName.newTestInstance() without keywords new. But the parameter should be provider in class level
it'll make a little confuse in the main class

Ola is a normal parameter provided instance
another is empty constructor new instance.
