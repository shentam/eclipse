the getHeadNumber method is used to generate 6 luck numbers from 1-59
the getBonus method is used to generate 1 bonus number from the left numbers
the out put method is used to build a string which can be displayed
the getReadNumber method is used to generate another 2 numbers from 1-59
the genertateLottery method is used to generate 6+2 numbers

the difference between getBonus and generateLottery is getBonus generate 7 numbers from 1-59 without repeat.
it uses two for loop to avoid repeat. it's absolutely followed the algorithm. 
there's another simply way to implement it,
 that is:modify and  invoke the getHeadNumber method to create 7 numbers from 1-59 and before sort list pick up the 7th number as the bonus and print out. But it's not the true algorithm.
